# 2FA TOTP

TOTP is a time-based one-time password algorithm. You can use it to authenticate your account.
Use one of the apps on your phone to generate the codes:
- Authy
- Google Authenticator
- Microsoft Authenticator
- other "authenticator" apps

## Why use 2FA?

- It's more secure than just a password or minecraft account.
- For more privileged users like admins, 2FA means a higher level of security.

## How does it work?

1. You enter the code generated by your authenticator app.
2. If the code is correct, you can log in.

Even if you have password enabled, you can still use 2FA.

## Enabling 2FA

Every registered player can enable 2FA using the [/setup2fa](/general/commands.html#setup2fa) command.
- 1. User will receive a secret that they need to enter in the authenticator app or they can scan generated QR code.

- 3. If the correct code was provided, then the setup is complete.
