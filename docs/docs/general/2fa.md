# 2FA TOTP

TOTP is a time-based one-time password algorithm. You can use it to authenticate your account.
Use one of the apps on your phone to generate the codes:
- Authy (preferred)
- Google Authenticator
- Microsoft Authenticator
- other "authenticator" apps

## Enabling 2FA

Every registered player can enable 2FA using the [/setup2fa](/general/commands.html#setup2fa) command.
- 1. User will receive a secret that they need to enter in the authenticator app or they can scan generated QR code.

- 3. If the correct code was provided, then the setup is complete.
