# Requirements

## What is required to run NavAuth?
- Velocity (preferably the newest versions)
- Limbo server e.g., NanoLimbo, PicoLimbo
- You can use [PicoLimbo velocity plugin](https://modrinth.com/plugin/picolimbo-java-wrapper) for simplicity.
::: danger
DO NOT USE NORMAL PAPER/LOBBY SERVER AS LIMBO. IT CAN CAUSE A MAJOR SECURITY ISSUE.
:::

## Modern forwarding is required
Please set **Velocity** forwarding to `MODERN`.
All backend servers must support `MODERN` forward too (**1.13.1+ only**).
